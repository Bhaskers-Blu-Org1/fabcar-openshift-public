# Summary

> Blockchain is not only about cutting out the middle-man and being able to transact on a network directly with your peers but also about having nodes in multiple locations such that the network cannot be compromised through a single point of failure - decentralization is one of the most important aspects of blockchain.  The more decentralized your network is, the harder it is to bring your network down, or manipulate it maliciously. Through the power of Kubernetes, and more specifically the Red Hat OpenShift platform, the IBM Blockchain Platform is now more decentralized than ever. It can easily be deployed on all of the major cloud providers, on your own hardware, or a combination of the two. 

# Technologies

[Blockchain](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/blockchain/): A blockchain is a tamper-evident, shared digital ledger that records transactions in a public or private peer-to-peer network. The blockchain acts as a single source of truth, and members in a blockchain network can view only those transactions that are relevant to them.
[Containers](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/containers/): A Containers architecture enables multiple services to run on the same machine, isolated from each other, in the same way as virtual machines, but with much less overhead.


# Description
> With the new IBM Blockchain Platform 2.1.0, you now have the flexibility to deploy components on the cloud of your choice - whether that is IBM Cloud, Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud. Not only that, but you can get the same functionality that is expected with the original IBM Blockchain Platform, consistently, across different clouds, whether that is public, private, or even hybrid. More specifically, you can deploy the IBM Blockchain Platform on any x86_64 architecture that is supported by OpenShift 3.11 and meets the system and environment requirements. From there, you can import components from other networks, onboard other organizations to your current channel, and easily expand your network.

When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

Create an OpenShift cluster.
Log in to an OpenShift cluster.
Create and a new project and add security and access policies.
Deploy the IBM Blockchain console and log in to the console.
Deploy a smart contract and run transactions on the IBM Blockchain Platform running on OpenShift.

# Flow Description
1. The blockchain operator purchases an entitlement to the IBM Blockchain Platform V2.1.0.
2. The blockchain operator deploys the IBM Blockchain Platform (which is running the latest Hyperledger Fabric version) onto
a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. The operator creates a network onto the IBM Blockchain platform, eventually installing and instantiating the Fabcar smart contract on the network.
3. The Node.js application server uses the Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network on IBM Blockchain Platform and creates APIs for a web client.
4. The Angular client uses the Node.js Fabric SDK to interact with the network.
5. The User interacts with the Fabcar Angular web application to update and query the blockchain state.
